        <h1>Rhythm Game</h1>
        <p>Rhythm game is a genre of game where you play the while reacting to the song or music. Usually the game mechanic is there is a note falling down and you have click when the note touches the judgement line. The number of notes and timing of it touching the judgement line is according to the music rhythm.
